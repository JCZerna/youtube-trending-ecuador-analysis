# 📊 YouTube Content Strategy Dashboard (Ecuador Market)

## 📋 Project Overview
The purpose of this Power BI dashboard is to give Ecuadorian content producers useful information. The program determines the **"Golden Hour"** for publishing and the ideal video duration to optimize audience interaction by examining engagement rates across various categories and times.

## 🛠️ Data Engineering Workflow (The "Under the Hood" Part)
> **Note:** This project uses a hybrid approach, combining Power BI's visualization capabilities with R's statistical power.

### 1) ETL with RStudio Wrangling:
* The raw YouTube metadata was cleaned using **R**.
* To classify video lengths, the `duration_range` buckets were designed.
* Temporal data was formatted to enable hourly engagement mapping.

### 2) Power BI Visualization:
* The cleaned R-output was connected for the UI design and final modeling.

## 💡 Key Strategic Insights
* **The "Golden Hour":** 9:00 PM was determined to be the peak strategy hour for overall engagement by custom DAX research.
* **The 10-20 Min Sweet Spot:** Although many producers concentrate on short-form content, the data shows that when videos are between **10 and 20 minutes** long, there is a notable increase in interaction (almost **15%**) for comedic content.
* **Category Outliers:** Regardless of the overall volume of videos, comedy and gaming routinely beat established categories in terms of engagement.

## ⚙️ Technical Features
* **Dynamic KPIs:** DAX metrics were used to determine "Peak Strategy Hour" and "Average Engagement %."
* **Advanced Interactivity:** Provides a temporal heatmap to compare performance by hour and niche, as well as a multi-select category slicer.
* **Visual Optimization:** High-performing outliers like Comedy were highlighted using a high-contrast category color scheme (**Semantic Resonance**).
* **Data Cleaning:** To make trend analysis cleaner, raw YouTube metadata was converted into binned duration ranges.

## 🎨 Data Storytelling
The dashboard has a deliberate, modern dark theme:
* **Top Ribbon:** High-level KPIs for quick "at-a-glance" decisions.
* **Heatmap:** Shows trends of audience "availability" over the course of the day.
* **Performance Chart:** A clustered column chart that compares the length of videos in five major areas to ascertain production strategy.
